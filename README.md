# Predicting-number-of-failures
To predict the times a system will fail in the next hour when given timestamp of failures

## Problem Summary:
The timestamp of failures were given in JSON file. I had the following task in hand:
1. Aggregate timestamps on 15 minute time intervals
2. Visualise and find underlying patterns of the number of failures. Discuss the insights on these visualisations
3. Implement a forecasting method at the same 15-minute granularity over the next hour 
(4 periods ahead) and discuss the method in detail explaining its accuracy
